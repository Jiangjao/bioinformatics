# treelib-js

Javascript phylogenetic tree library.

Currently supports reading Newick trees and NEXUS-format tree files and rendering tree in SVG. Library has no dependencies, but demos use JQuery and [talos/jquery-svgpan](https://github.com/talos/jquery-svgpan). The code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/rdmpage/treelib-js/blob/master/mit-license.md).

#### Demos

The demos folder contains simple web pages where you can paste in a Newick tree or a NEXUS tree file and get a tree in various styles.
