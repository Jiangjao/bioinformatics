we propose ikarus, a machine learning pipeline aimed at distinguishing tumor cells 
from normal cells at the single-cell level

consists of two steps: 
(1) discovery of a comprehensive tumor cell signature in the form of a gene set by consolidation of multiple expertly annotated single-cell datasets 

(2) training of a robust logistic regression classifer for stringent discrimination of tumor 
and normal cells followed by a network-based propagation of cell labels using a custom 
built cellâ€“cell network
